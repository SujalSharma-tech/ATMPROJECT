# ATMPROJECT
A simple ATM machine project made in python....

made using loops, conditional statements, some colors, file handling and printing statements.

working:- 
Default card number = 123456789
Default pin = 8880
First it verifies the card which is already stored in the program
Then it asks for the pin if the pin is incorrect after 3 tries it blocks the card and ends the program
we can withdraw, deposit, check balance and also change the pin in realtime which make use of file handling.
You can Reset pin incase you forget the pin.
Thank you
