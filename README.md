# ATMPROJECT
A small ATM machine project made in python....

made using loops, conditional statements, some colors and printing statements.

working:- 
card number = 123456789
pin = 8880
First it verifies the card which is already stored in the program
Then it asks for the pin if the pin is incorrect after 3 tries it blocks the card and ends the program
we can withdraw, deposit and check balance in this
Thank you
